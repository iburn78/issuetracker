Notes:
- published post's images may remain in private image folder in the server
- may need to write image-clean-up code
- in private mode, if brower access public card through url, it shows public card content in private environment: it should be OK
- popstate-javascript code (implemented to prevent brower's back button) seems working when a user does an activity in the current page (whatever it is), othwerwise popstate event does not fire: seems this is more reasonable in a sense
- all the server errors are out-of-memory errors so far (2022-10-24) killed by OOM manager
